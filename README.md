# Object-Oriented-Programming-in-Python


In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.
The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code that makes it easier to work with larger programmes.
OOP programs prevent you from repeating code because a class can be defined once and reused many times.
